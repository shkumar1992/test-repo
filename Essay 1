I began my career as a Graduate Analyst in Citicorp India and worked on various kinds of technologies and worked with people across the globe. At Citi, I was able to further my leadership and interpersonal skills and understand how multinational organizations function. It was during this time that I started to think of finance as a career option. I registered for the CFA examination and was able to clear both Level I and Level II in my first attempts. As I aim to start and develop my career in the field of finance and management, it is very essential that I further hone my skills and develop into an industry ready professional. I already have great quantitative and analytical skills, what I need is to further hone my managerial and financial skills to succeed as a finance professional.
Doing an MBA will be the most logical extension of my work experience and passion, and a major stepping stone toward my goals. An MBA will help me to further develop my managerial and communication skills. It will provide me with not only knowledge but also exposure to people from various walks of life. Thus, Imperial College Business School seems to be the perfect choice for doing an MBA. Imperial has a great history, extensive alumni network, a learning system that emphasis on practical thinking and experience, and of course a great location. An institution like Imperial will only affirmatively help me realize my ambitions and present me with world-class opportunities.
