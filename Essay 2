I was born a curious child and was always into exploring new things and seeking out knowledge. Being sharp minded and good at grasping new concepts, I was always good at studies. I finished my schooling as the topper of my school. I was awarded Amul Vidya Shree for my performance in High School Board Examinations and was even offered INSPIRE Scholarship by the Ministry of Science and Technology. After some rigorous preparation I got admitted to one of India’s most prestigious Engineering Institutes, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur. At IIT Kharagpur, I got to meet new people, learned about different cultures and made really great friends. In my second year, I was even elected as the Maintenance Secretary of my hostel and was given the responsibility of looking after the maintenance of the hostel and ensuring that the maintenance budget is properly utilized. I was also part of the National Cadet Corps for the first two years of college and was able to successfully clear the B-Certificate Examination of NCC.
After my graduation I joined Citicorp India as Graduate Analyst and worked in two different teams during this time. In my first year I worked in the Market Research Team and from the second year onwards I worked in the Robotic Process Automation Team. Apart from the daily BAU work, I was also involved in various initiatives at Cit. I started a Discussion Forum for Graduates and New Hires and was also part of the team the implemented a generic dashboarding solution that is being used across various businesses of Citi. In my third year I even got the opportunity to lead a team and was even awarded the “Young Bud Award” for being showing leadership qualities in my first project. I am also a part of Toastmasters and through it I am able to further improve my inter-personal and public speaking skills.
All these experiences have helped me
